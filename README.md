### Acknowledgement

Damn Vulnerable DeFi is the wargame to learn offensive security of DeFi smart contracts.

Throughout numerous challenges you will build the skills to become a bug hunter or security auditor in the space. 🕵️‍♂️

## How To Play 🕹️

1.  **Install Foundry**

First run the command below to get foundryup, the Foundry toolchain installer:

``` bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your PATH, run it to get the latest forge and cast binaries:

``` console
foundryup
```

2. **Clone This Repo and install dependencies**
``` 
git clone https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry.git
cd damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry
forge install
```
3. **Code your solutions in the provided `[NAME_OF_THE_LEVEL].t.sol` files (inside each level's folder in the test folder)**
4. **Run your exploit for a challenge**
```
make [CONTRACT_LEVEL_NAME]
```
or
```
./run.sh [LEVEL_FOLDER_NAME]
./run.sh [CHALLENGE_NUMBER]
./run.sh [4_FIRST_LETTER_OF_NAME] 
```
If the challenge is executed successfully, you've passed!🙌🙌

### Tips and tricks ✨
- In all challenges you must use the account called attacker. In Forge, you can use the [cheat code](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/tree/master/forge#cheat-codes) `prank` or `startPrank`.
- To code the solutions, you may need to refer to the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
- In some cases, you may need to code and deploy custom smart contracts.

### Preinstalled dependencies

`ds-test` for testing, `forge-std` for better cheatcode UX, and `openzeppelin-contracts` for contract implementations.
