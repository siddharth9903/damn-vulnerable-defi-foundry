git clone https://github.com/nicolasgarcia214/damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry.git
cd damn-vulnerable-defi-foundry
forge install

3. **Code your solutions in the provided `[NAME_OF_THE_LEVEL].t.sol` files (inside each level's folder in the test folder)**
4. **Run your exploit for a challenge**
```

### Tips and tricks ‚ú®
- In all challenges you must use the account called attacker. In Forge, you can use the [cheat code](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/tree/master/forge#cheat-codes) `prank` or `startPrank`.
- To code the solutions, you may need to refer to the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
- In some cases, you may need to code and deploy custom smart contracts.

### Preinstalled dependencies

`ds-test` for testing, `forge-std` for better cheatcode UX, and `openzeppelin-contracts` for contract implementations.
